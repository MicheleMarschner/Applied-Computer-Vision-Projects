        "The experiments in this project are based on the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) handwritten digits dataset. All dataset manipulation, curation, and analysis were conducted using FiftyOne, PyTorch, and FiftyOne Brain. The full pipeline spans dataset preparation, automated data diagnostics, the introduction of an IDK (I-Don’t-Know) class, and the construction of datasets for training both a standard 10-class model and an uncertainty-aware 11-class model.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Dataset Loading: The official MNIST train and test splits were imported directly from the FiftyOne Dataset Zoo.\n",
        "2. Deterministic Splitting: The original 60,000-sample training split was divided into an 85% training subset (51,000 samples) and a 15% validation subset (9,000 samples) using a fixed random seed to ensure reproducibility.\n",
        "3. Baseline Model Training: A modernized LeNet-5 architecture was trained from scratch in PyTorch. The best-performing checkpoint was selected based on validation loss.\n",

Automated Data Analysis: FiftyOne Brain metrics—including embeddings, hardness, mistakenness, and uniqueness—were computed to identify sources of ambiguity and potential annotation errors. Samples flagged as non-digit, ambiguous, or inconsistent were either removed or relabeled as IDK.\n",
        "6. Targeted Augmentation: Samples that were very representative, samples that were rare but valid (correct label, but hard or unique) and a small set of idk-labelled data were identified as augmentation seeds to improve generalization to uncommon handwriting styles.\n",
        "7. Consistent IDK Strategy: The same curation logic was applied to both the validation and test splits to obtain clean and ambiguity-aware evaluation datasets.\n",

In each round, the current model was applied to the curated training set, and FiftyOne Brain metrics (hardness, mistakenness, uniqueness, representativeness) were recomputed.\n",
