        "The experiments in this project are based on the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) handwritten digits dataset. All dataset manipulation, curation, and analysis were conducted using FiftyOne, PyTorch, and FiftyOne Brain. The full pipeline spans dataset preparation, automated data diagnostics, the introduction of an IDK (I-Don’t-Know) class, and the construction of datasets for training both a standard 10-class model and an uncertainty-aware 11-class model.\n",

        "3. Baseline Model Training: A modernized LeNet-5 architecture was trained from scratch in PyTorch. The best-performing checkpoint was selected based on validation loss.\n",
