    "# Text-to-Image Conditional Diffusion with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)\n",
    "\n",
    "This project trains and evaluates a text-to-image diffusion model on a cropped version of the TF Flowers dataset, with the goal of generating realistic flower images that can be steered by text prompts while still supporting unconditional generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach combines three components:\n",
    "* CLIP text encoder to convert prompts into semantic conditioning vectors\n",
    "* U-Net–based DDPM to denoise and generate images through the reverse diffusion process\n",
    "* Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) to strengthen text conditioning at sampling time without training a separate classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We build an end-to-end evaluation pipeline for a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generation + Feature Extraction:** We generate flower images using CFG-based DDPM sampling conditioned on CLIP text embeddings, while extracting U-Net bottleneck features via forward hooks to analyze internal representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Quantitative Evaluation:** Generated samples are evaluated using:\n",
    "* CLIP Score to measure text–image semantic alignment\n",
    "* Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) to assess distribution-level realism\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Representation Analysis and Visualization:** The extracted bottleneck embeddings are stored in a FiftyOne dataset to enable interactive exploration and to compute metrics such as uniqueness and representativeness, linking generation behavior to internal feature structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Experiment tracking (Weights & Biases):** For reproducibility and easy comparison across runs, we log all key hyperparameters, sampling settings, metrics, and evaluation outputs to the _diffusion-model-assessment-v2_ W&B project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extension (second experimental notebook)**\n",
    "Building on this evaluation pipeline, a second experimental notebook extends the sampling setup to generate higher-quality images. It explores improved sampling settings (e.g., stronger/optimized guidance, more samples per prompt, and/or refined sampling parameters) to increase visual fidelity while keeping the same conditioning and evaluation framework, enabling direct qualitative comparison to the baseline results.\n"

    "\n",
    "##### 1. Consistency Between Visuals and Metrics\n",
    "The results show a clear and monotonic relationship between guidance strength 𝑤 and semantic alignment as measured by the CLIP score. As 𝑤 increases, the generated images become progressively more aligned with their text prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observations:**\n",
    "* w ≤ 0 - clip score at 0.11-0.18:\n",
    "  * Images appear weakly related or unrelated to the text prompt\n",
    "  * Flowers look blurry, abstract, or ambiguous\n",
    "* w = 0 - clip score at 0.179:\n",
    "  * Images start to show recognizable flower-like structures\n",
    "  * Prompt-specific features (such as color or shape) become more consistent\n",
    "* w ≥ 0 - clip score at 0.24-0.28:\n",
    "  * Images more clearly match the text prompt (e.g. roses, daisies, sunflowers become visually distinct)\n",
    "  * Color and structure are more stable across samples\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the quantitative CLIP scores are well aligned with qualitative visual inspection, indicating that the model successfully leverages text conditioning to guide semantic generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Diminishing Returns at High Guidance\n",
    "\n",
    "| Guidance w | Mean CLIP Score | n |\n",
    "|-----------:|---------------:|--:|\n",
    "| -2.0 | 0.1154 | 3 |\n",
    "| -1.0 | 0.1819 | 3 |\n",
    "| -0.5 | 0.1892 | 3 |\n",

    "|  0.5 | 0.2466 | 3 |\n",
    "|  1.0 | 0.2854 | 3 |\n",
    "|  2.0 | 0.2870 | 3 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Although CLIP scores increase with guidance strength, the improvement becomes marginal at higher values. This suggests that semantic alignment begins to saturate and that w≈1.0 to 2.0 might be the \"sweet spot\" for this model. Beyond this range, higher guidance primarily amplifies contrast or introduces artifacts rather than adding meaningful semantic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Overall CLIP Performance and Experimental Context\n",
    "Across all experiments, the average CLIP score is 0.2121, indicating a **moderate but meaningful level of semantic alignment** between generated images and their prompts. Given the experimental constraints—most notably the low image resolution (32×32) and the inclusion of weak or negative guidance values—this score is well within the expected range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, the goal of this assignment is not to maximize image quality, but to analyze how semantic alignment and diversity evolve as a function of guidance strength. Including negative and low guidance values provides insight into the trade-off between prompt adherence and sample diversity. This trade-off is further explored through U-Net embedding analysis and visualization with FiftyOne, offering a complementary perspective. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. Interpretation of the High FID Score\n",
    "The Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) score of approximately 320 is numerically high and would normally suggest poor generative quality. However, in this experimental setup, the absolute FID value is not a reliable indicator of visual or semantic quality.\n",
    "Small **sample size** (n=21) and the **resolution mismatch** (upsampling of 32x32 to 299x299) influence the high score rather than just poor semantic quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. Future adjustments to increase the quality of the generated images\n",
    "To further enhance the generative quality and semantic fidelity of the diffusion model, the following optimizations should be implemented:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extended Training & Dynamic Learning Rate: Extending the training of the original U-Net model and automatically reducing the learning rate with a dedicated scheduler that monitors the validation loss will enable the model to better capture high-frequency details and intricate textures. \n",
    "2. Prompt Variation & Semantic Generalization: Text prompts should be increased to include more semantic variation, e.g. \"A red rose with layered petals\" or \"A close-up of a daisy\". This creates a more robust mapping between CLIP text embeddings and visual features and ensures that the model can generalize to diverse descriptions.\n",
    "3. Hyperparameter Search for Guidance (w): A systematic search to find the optimal guidance weight would help to identifiy the point where prompt alignment is maximized before over-saturation begins to degrade image quality again.\n",
    "4. Targeted Quality Filtering: The final output should be filtered to retain only the images generated with the highest guidance strengths. This ensures that the final evaluation is only done on high-fidelity samples that possess clear structures and definitive subject matter.\n"
